# Security: HTTPS Enforcement
# By default, HTTP URLs are rejected for security (prevents credentials over plain HTTP)

# DANGER: Only use in development environments, never in production!

# Session Management Configuration
# Session timeout in seconds (default: 28800 = 8 hours)
# Sessions automatically expire after this duration with TTL enforcement

# Maximum concurrent sessions per user (default: 5)
# Limits the number of simultaneous sessions a single user can have
# Set to 0 for unlimited sessions (not recommended for production)
# When exceeded, the oldest session is automatically removed

# Session cleanup interval in seconds (default: 300 = 5 minutes)
# Background task runs periodically to remove expired sessions
# Lower values increase cleanup frequency but use more CPU
# Recommended: 60-600 seconds depending on session volume

# Rate Limiting Configuration (Login Attempts)
# Protects against brute force attacks using sliding window algorithm

# Maximum login attempts per user before lockout (default: 5)
# Tracks failed login attempts within the rate limiting window
# Set to 0 to disable rate limiting (not recommended for production)

# How long a user is locked out after exceeding max attempts
# User can retry after this period expires

# Rate limit cleanup interval in seconds (default: 300 = 5 minutes)
# Background task runs periodically to remove old rate limit data
# Prevents memory leaks from accumulated login attempt records
