## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Story Dependencies

- **US-3.3** (Input Validation Tests): No dependencies → Can start immediately
- **US-2.6** (Delete Validation Fix): No dependencies on other stories → Can run in parallel with US-3.3
- **US-3.4** (Delete Operation Tests): Depends on US-2.6 validation fix (test after fix) → Start after T030
- **US-3.5** (Edge Case Testing): No dependencies on other stories → Can run in parallel with US-3.4

### Parallel Opportunities

**Week 1 (Day 1-3)**:
- US-3.3 tests (T006-T016) run in parallel
- US-2.6 validation fix (T026-T028) runs in parallel with US-3.3

**Week 1 (Day 4-5)**:
- US-3.4 delete tests (T031-T040) after US-2.6 validation complete (T030)
- US-3.5 edge case tests (T046-T053) can start in parallel with US-3.4 on different team member

**Week 2**:
- Quality gates (T060-T069) run after all user story tests complete
- Release preparation (T070-T078) after quality gates pass

### Suggested Team Allocation (2 developers)

**Developer A**: US-3.3 + US-3.4 (tests first, then validation fix, then delete tests)
- T006-T020 (US-3.3 tests + verification)
- T026-T030 (US-2.6 validation fix)
- T031-T045 (US-3.4 delete tests)

**Developer B**: US-2.6 (fix) + US-3.5 (edge cases in parallel)
- T021-T025 (US-2.6 tests)
- T046-T059 (US-3.5 edge case tests in parallel with Dev A's US-3.4)

**Both**: Quality gates and release
- T060-T078 (quality validation and release prep)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Sprints 1-3 Already Complete)

Sprints 1-3 delivered the MVP:
- Input validation framework
- Session management with TTL, rate limiting, concurrent limits
- Secure logging and error handling
- Code quality and type hints
- All deployed to production

### Sprint 4: Final Polish & Comprehensive Testing

Sprint 4 completes the epic with:
1. **Input Validation Test Suite** (US-3.3): Prove all validation rules work
